Extend to them all the care, kindness and understanding you can muster, and do it with no thought of any reward. Your life will never be the same again.\\n\\nOg Mandino\\n\\n', \"\\nLearn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don't wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored.\\n\\nEarl Nightingale\\n\\n\", '\\nNo matter what has happened to you in the past or what is going on in your life right now, it has no power to keep you from having an amazingly good future if you will walk by faith in God. God loves you! He wants you to live with victory over sin so you can possess His promises for your life today!\\n\\nJoyce Meyer\\n\\n', '\\nOnly I can change my life. No one can do it for me.\\n\\nCarol Burnett\\n\\n', '\\nSecurity is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it.
